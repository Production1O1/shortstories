 School At home
     By. Anvay S.



Let’s say you’re on a trip enjoying yourself and realize, Oh no! I have school! That means I’m gonna miss Five Days of SCHOOL! Well, That’s how annoyed everyone feels.  Like what if you’re sick, or what if you’re on a trip? Even Priya Gadia, who has to wake up early to send her son to school says, “It’s so annoying to send my kids to school, why not do it online?” That is why I think School Should Have Work From Home Days.
My first reason Schools Should Have Work From Home Days is because what if you’re on a trip or you are sick. What you could do is work while you’re on your vacation, or if you’re sick. How it’d work is you use a video calling app such as Zoom and attend online just like when Covid-19 struck the world. To add on, If you’re on a trip , you don’t need to shorten up your trip because you can attend through your trip! But sometimes you’re traveling around during your trip and cannot attend Zoom. Because of this you only need to attend four hours. Also, you might need to stay at a location for a long time for any reason.
