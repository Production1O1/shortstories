Morrel, a nine year old boy, was having a sleepover. Morrel went by Morr as his name. Today Morr was going CRAZY, he was having a sleepover! He couldn’t wait to see his buddies!
 “Mom, when are they coming? I’m getting bored!”
…DING-DONG!  Morr rushed to get the door, he saw what seemed to be his friends.
  “He-,” Morr began. 
  “Delivery for… Maddie Remhed?” 
It wasn’t Morr’s friends, it was the delivery man! Morr rushed inside to get his mom.
 “Mom! There’s a delivery for you,’’ Morr said.
 “Just go get the mail, Morr,” Morr’s mom replied.
Morr went and got the delivery. He placed the package on the counter and sighed. 
Ugh, when will they come! It’s already 5:36! They said they’ll come at 5:30! Then I got embarrassed by talking to the delivery man! Morr thought. 
 After what seemed like forever to Morr, there was a knock on the door.
 “Finally you guys came! You guys were ten minutes late, Alon and Rol!’’ Morr exclaimed.
Rol and Alon exchanged looks. They were confused about why they would be late for being ten minutes out of time. 
  “Morr, being ten minutes late is not what you call late. Get used to it,” said Rol. 
 Within five minutes of their arrival, They were now inside playing  on their Ipads.
  A little bit later, Morr and his friends, Rol and Alon, had just finished their dinner and were now playing some more on the Ipads.
  “Nooo! Xx_Royal captured me!” yelled Morr.
  Morr and his friends were playing some Roblox on the Ipad.
  “Morr!” yelled Morr’s mom. “I’m going to bed, Morr, and DON'T YOU DARE WA–,” Morr’s mom began to yell.
 “I know, I know,” Replied Morr nervously.
Morr felt sick in the stomach, He forgot he’d have to sleep without his mom. 
Uh oh… I don’t know how I’m gonna sleep by myself tonight! I mean, maybe just maybe if I try to convince Rol and Alon to stay awake tonight I won’t feel alone. Ok, fingers crossed! thought Morr
 “Uhm… He– … Alon? Rol? Can You stay awake tonight? I know it’s an odd question just like- Can you?” said Morr as he crossed one of his fingers.
