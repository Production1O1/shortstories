Phil and his journey


	 Once there was a boy named Phil. He never EVER got below 100! Even on his finals! The teachers named him “Acer” because in 2nd Grade, he was moved to 6th! And in 7th Grade he was in 12! He graduated from school! He went to Larna University, Only 100 students around the WORLD get to go! And that is, He was the ONLY 8th Grader in Larna. Even in college, Phil always got 100s and maybe 105! Everybody wanted to team up with him for group projects. After graduating #1 around the world, he decided to open up his own tech company, BioClick. He got 3 BILLION customers! After that, he wasn’t done, he wanted to open up districts and education, starting with Edus. Edus would be an iPad that taught you stuff and was like a mini homeschool. Phil didn’t only have success though, At first, Edus seemed useless and expensive for 125$. Phil was in 123,000,000 debt. And he Couldn’t quite ALWAYS get 100. The first test he took was a 82, then 71, 52, and then 98, and then 100! He used to not care, always played Video Games, and was rude. Phil then fixed it and promised to get A grades For EVER! It came to Phil. What if he did the same right now? He made Edus only 25$, and then he stopped buying useless stuff. 120,000,000 to 34,000,000 and then 500k, and 13$, and eventually NO debt! Phil did this for all his life until at age 37, 5006, News around the world spread that education was bad, AI would be doing BETTER than humans, and only the top 1% would get jobs. Phil wasn’t in trouble, but the world was. He needed to do something, and quickly. He started by opening schools that were both ONLINE and offline. Tutoring classes, More Stories he made that were harder, and he challenged kids. Now, He made a TINY difference. Only the top 2% would get jobs. Soon, Schools shut down, and the world was boring to those who had NOTHING. Luckily, Phil’s schools were doing AWESOME! He started making schools all over the world. And after he made a university BETTER than Larna, but more students would be accepted. Yorso Link University, YLI was the BEST now! And 5k students were accepted now! He opened up 30 of these YLI colleges.
