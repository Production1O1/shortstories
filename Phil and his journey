Phil and his journey


	 Once there was a boy named Phil. He never EVER got below 100! Even on his finals! The teachers named him “Acer” because in 2nd Grade, he was moved to 6th! And in 7th Grade he was in 12! He graduated from school! He went to Larna University, Only 100 students around the WORLD get to go! And that is, He was the ONLY 8th Grader in Larna. Even in college, Phil always got 100s and maybe 105! Everybody wanted to team up with him for group projects. After graduating #1 around the world, he decided to open up his own tech company, BioClick. He got 3 BILLION customers! After that, he wasn’t done, he wanted to open up districts and education, starting with Edus. Edus would be an iPad that taught you stuff and was like a mini homeschool. Phil didn’t only have success though, At first, Edus seemed useless and expensive for 125$. Phil was in 123,000,000 debt. And he Couldn’t quite ALWAYS get 100. The first test he took was a 82, then 71, 52, and then 98, and then 100! He used to not care, always played Video Games, and was rude. Phil then fixed it and promised to get A grades For EVER! It came to Phil. What if he did the same right now? He made Edus only 25$, and then he stopped buying useless stuff. 120,000,000 to 34,000,000 and then 500k, and 13$, and eventually NO debt! Phil did this for all his life until at age 37, 5006, News around the world spread that education was bad, AI would be doing BETTER than humans, and only the top 1% would get jobs. Phil wasn’t in trouble, but the world was. He needed to do something, and quickly. He started by opening schools that were both ONLINE and offline. Tutoring classes, More Stories he made that were harder, and he challenged kids. Now, He made a TINY difference. Only the top 2% would get jobs. Soon, Schools shut down, and the world was boring to those who had NOTHING. Luckily, Phil’s schools were doing AWESOME! He started making schools all over the world. And after he made a university BETTER than Larna, but more students would be accepted. Yorso Link University, YLI was the BEST now! And 5k students were accepted now! He opened up 30 of these YLI colleges.




 Then he also opened up Lesso, The 10th Best university! 10k students were accepted! There were AT LEAST 100 of these! Phil took over the educational system, Tech System, Now what. Phil was the #1 Most smart person. Simply He could give on that knowledge. Phil had heard about MiltinLink, A hospital for kids who need it. They got NO education. Phil opened up MediLearn. MediLearn seemed dumb at first, even to the DOCTORS! It was a worksheet form. It’d ask you your favorite color, what is your hobby, write your own story, Did you enjoy this, and some questions that tricked kids into Math and Reading! Soon Doctors saw improvement, and they did tests and were shocked. Looked like Phil was doing spectacular! But not so much. A Hurricane with winds of 670 mph and oceans of water on streets for 2.5 weeks, everyone had not worried except Phil. 99% of the world believed that Phil would be able to STOP the hurricane. He thought for hours, and hours. Simply, Phil would hide. He’d hide in his bunker. When the hurricane passed it was MUCH more than expected. It destroyed 10% of the world and killed 1 BILLION People or injured them. Furiosity was on everyone on Phil, He had done NOTHING to save them. Everyone stopped buying Phil’s products, and Everyone stayed away from Phil’s schools and colleges. Phil had been so bad that he was a wanted criminal now. He would have to hide. Somewhere he, and his belongings, and his knowledge of course, were safe. He hid in a dumpster, Nah, too basic and smelly! His bunker wasn’t that safe, but when it came to him, he started building a pad, Engines, wings, and more.
