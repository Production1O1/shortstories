Introduction
Hamster and dogs and cats and  chinchilla and  fishes and ferret, a turtle, a lizard, and a tarantula. None of those animals are your type. You want a soft, small, friendly companion for you. But none of the pets at the pet store has an animal like that. What about the rescue? Dogs, cats, and bunnies. Still none you want. Okay, you try one more. Dogs, hamsters, bunnies, cats, and guinea pigs! That’s it, a guinea pig! So now you just need to do some research on guinea pigs. This article’s gonna have that all in here. So read to find out some fascinating things about guinea pigs! 


 Guinea pigs are more than just an animal?!
  Guinea pigs are more than just an animal. They are what is called a rodent. A rodent is a mammal which are warm blooded animals. Many animals such as hamsters, guinea pigs -like I mentioned-, rats, prairie dogs, capybaras, beavers, porcupines, and squirrels are some examples of rodents.
 	Guinea pigs are also herbivores. This means they only eat vegetables and no meat. And still, they get ALL their nutrients they need to survive. I personally do like how they are herbivores because of how expensive meat is and in some religions, they don’t like meat or they don’t like a specific type of meat.
	But did you know that guinea pigs are a good pet? I mean, I wouldn’t be writing about pet guinea pigs if they weren’t. In my opinion, guinea pigs are awesome pets and I’m about to tell you why. Guinea pigs are really friendly, they seek human attention, unless you don’t care for them properly. They love you for giving them all the glory. They otherwise probably would be in the forest getting hunted by a predator. Predator means an animal that tries to kill its “food.”
	But lastly there is something you’d rather NOT think about, and it's that they are pretty expensive pets. They need check ups, food, and other accessories.
