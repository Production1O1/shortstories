Hello! My name is James Earl Carter Jr. but you can call me Jimmy Carter! I was born in 1924. I am 99 years old and almost 100! I am most known for being the president and being a peacemaker, I don’t give up for what I think is right!
 
 As a kid, my parents taught me to be fair and look for new challenges. I’d work at my dad's farm. My mom was a nurse. At the time, segregation would occur throughout the south. I lived in the south but we didn’t care! Everyone was equal.

I have accomplished many things in my life. Let me tell you what happend. I worked in the Navy. I worked hard each day. I was promoted to the Top Officer. Sadly 1 year after, my dad, Earl, died. When I went to his funeral I saw he was a big leader to the community. I made a hard decision to take over his role.

At first I wanted to be a Lawmaker of Georgia. I got ready and gave it my all! I didn’t win due to cheating. I told the court and they said I won! Then I decided to take it a notch up, being Governor of Georgia. My first try I lost. I tried even harder and I won! Then, I tried running for president. Lots didn’t think I could do it, many didn’t even know me, all I know is I gave it my best shot and hoped for the best. I was president! 

Many people admire me because I never gave up, who knows if I gave up who’d be the 39th president. I never gave up because I knew challenges would interfere, but not STOP me.

I was a peacemaker all throughout my life. I put Egypt and Israel to peace and I went all around the globe to provide food. I also like carpeting and worked for an organization called Habitat for Humanity.

I opened up the Carter Center! I got the Nobel Peace prize in 2002 for being one of the BEST peacemakers. I put over 60 nations to peace and am ready to do more! I once said,  “I do what I do because I think it is the right thing to do.”
