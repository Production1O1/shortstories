Once the Solar System had never had gravity. A girl named Perlona would make gravity go away. Her body sucked up all the gravity. She knew everything about space. Many people would ask her to educate them on space. She could tell from what happend from the big boom, she is immortal. Many worried she had the power to make earth vanish if she was mad.	
The Skyworld had no sky, they were the sky. And they could see space. They asked Perlona to make space pretty, and she did. The planets were closer, rainbows shot across the space, and rings would be around Earth. Skie, the queen of Skyworld was astonished! But there was also an underworld. They had magma bursting up, bugs burrowing, and no beauty. They one day sent a mission from the underground to see Earth, the sea levels. They saw the sky and gazed up, beauty it was they’ve never seen. “Oh my demons! This is amazing! We need to take this!” One devil said, another said, “I’m staying here!” They went back down and dug for hours, the crust they had arrived at where Demon Burzock lived. “Demon, We need to take that BEAUTY!” And so they set a mission for beauty, which was actually Perlona. 	
News spread quickly on Earth but Perlona didn’t know. “Oh what are you!” Said Perlona “I’m here to show you something pretty, the underworld!” The devil was stunned by the beauty she had. Perlona followed the devil with no questions. When they took Perlona down she started to burn, the devils laughed and laughed. At last BOOOOM! Perlona burst! She had started to levitate to space and go in the center, she provided gravity now! She was named the sun. To this day she provides gravity, but the beauty is now gone. Some folks who put their ears to the ground can hear something bursting and lots yelling.
